Node.js-Express-MongoDB Boilerplate with Authentication, OTP Password Feature, and Mongoose-based Factory

This boilerplate offers a comprehensive solution for building secure web applications using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose. In addition to authentication and OTP password features, it provides a Mongoose-based factory for simplifying various database operations.

Features:

User Authentication:

Implements user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication and authorization.
Supports user registration, login, logout, and password reset functionalities.
OTP Password Feature:

Enhances security by implementing OTP-based password authentication.
Generates one-time passwords for users during login or sensitive operations.
Utilizes time-based or HMAC-based OTP algorithms for generating secure OTPs.
Mongoose-based Factory:

Offers a factory pattern for handling various Mongoose operations, providing a clean and modular approach to database interactions.
Simplifies CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for MongoDB collections/models.
Encapsulates common Mongoose queries, allowing easy reuse and abstraction of database logic.
Express Framework:

Utilizes Express.js, a minimalist web framework for Node.js, for building robust APIs and web applications.
Implements middleware for request handling, routing, and error management.
MongoDB Integration:

Integrates MongoDB, a flexible NoSQL database, for data storage and retrieval.
Utilizes Mongoose ODM (Object Data Modeling) for simplified interactions with MongoDB.
Secure Practices:

Implements secure password storage using hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt) to protect user credentials.
Utilizes best practices for session management and CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection.
Implements input validation and sanitization to prevent common security vulnerabilities.
Scalable and Extendable:

Designed with modularity in mind, allowing easy extension and integration of additional features.
Follows MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture for clean code organization and maintainability.
Usage:

Clone the repository and install dependencies.
Configure environment variables for database connection, JWT secret, and OTP settings.
Customize routes, controllers, and models according to your application requirements.
Utilize the Mongoose-based factory for simplified database operations, such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting documents.
Extend the functionality by adding additional features or integrating third-party libraries as needed.
Tech Stack:

Node.js
Express.js
MongoDB
Mongoose
JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
OTP Libraries (e.g., speakeasy, otp-authenticator)
bcrypt for password hashing
Note: Regularly review and update security practices and dependencies to maintain the security and stability of your application.
